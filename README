gcbayes README
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile:

make

To run:

Running the binary with the '-h' or '--help' flag gives usage information.

Examples:
gcbayes -N 25 -S 1 -X 500 -m -2.0 -p 0.05 -u 0.5 -s 0.2 -e 0.01 -a 1.4 -y ter5_wide.gc -w
gcbayes -N 14 -S 1 -X 225 -p 0.005 -e 0.001 -y 47tuc_narrow.gc

In addition to the compiled binary, the program requires two files in the run
directory - a configuration file, such as the file 'ter5_narrow.gc' included
here,and a file with individual pulsar flux densities listed in ascending
order, such as 'flux_ter5', also included here.
